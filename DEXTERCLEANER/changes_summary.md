# DexterOptiClean - Changes Summary

## 1. Fixed System Monitoring Errors

### Problem
The application was showing errors related to `os.statvfs` and Windows-specific functions:
- `Error getting disk usage: module 'os' has no attribute 'statvfs'`
- `Error getting free space: module 'os' has no attribute 'statvfs'`
- `Error getting total space: module 'os' has no attribute 'statvfs'`
- `Error getting uptime: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified`
- `Error getting load average: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified`

### Solution
- Updated `system_monitor.py` to use the cross-platform `psutil` library instead of direct OS calls
- Added proper fallbacks for Windows systems
- Implemented platform-independent methods for getting system statistics
- Improved error handling to prevent application crashes

## 2. Changed Scan Button to Clean All Button

### Problem
The original application had a "Scan System" button that would scan for files to clean, requiring an additional step to actually clean the files.

### Solution
- Replaced the "Scan System" button with a "Clean All" button
- Modified the HTML template to update the button text and icon
- Added a new API endpoint `/api/clean-all` that cleans all selected categories at once
- Implemented a new JavaScript function `cleanAllCategories()` that:
  - Shows a confirmation dialog
  - Displays a progress indicator
  - Calls the new API endpoint
  - Shows results when cleaning is complete

## 3. Improved User Experience

- Simplified the cleaning process by combining scanning and cleaning into a single step
- Added more descriptive progress messages during the cleaning process
- Maintained compatibility with existing category-specific cleaning options
- Ensured proper error handling and user feedback

## 4. Technical Implementation Details

1. **Backend Changes**:
   - Added new API endpoint `/api/clean-all` in `app.py`
   - Modified system monitoring to use `psutil` for cross-platform compatibility

2. **Frontend Changes**:
   - Updated button ID from `scan-btn` to `clean-all-btn`
   - Changed button text from "Scan System" to "Clean All"
   - Updated icon from search icon to broom icon
   - Added new JavaScript function for the clean all functionality

3. **User Flow Changes**:
   - Original flow: Click "Scan" → Wait for scan → Select files → Click "Clean"
   - New flow: Click "Clean All" → Confirm → Wait for cleaning to complete
